## Markdown syntax

Here's how markdown appears in the **{{.FrontMatter.Theme }}** theme
{{- if .FrontMatter.PageType }}
with the PageType **{{ .FrontMatter.PageType }}**.
{{ end }}

## Common text formatting

#### You type:
```
Normal body text, **strong**, ~~strikethrough~~, and with *emphasis*.
```

#### It shows as:
Normal body text, **strong**, ~~strikethrough~~, and with *emphasis*.

Horizontal rule:

#### You type:
```
---
```

#### It shows as:
---

## Links

#### You type:
```
[link text](https://appscripting.com)
```

#### It shows as:
[link text](https://appscripting.com)

## Bookmarks


Suppose you want to link to a particular location inside a page. As long as there's an `id` attribute in the document's HTML you can cause a link to jump directly to that part of the page by specifing the link following a `#` character. 

### Linking inside a document

We'll loosely call them anchors or bookmarks, although the HTML simply calls it the [id attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-id-attribute).

Here's a demonstration. If you type:

```
Jump to the [tables](#tables) section.
```

The result will be this (click the link, then use your browser's Back button to return here):  

Jump to the [tables](#tables) section.


### All headers are automatically bookmarks too

**Automatically** Metabuzz has a couple of ways for you to create those links. One way is the easiest: Metabuzz automatically generates an `id` attribute for each header from h1 to h6 by taking the text of the link itself, reducing it to lowercase, and either replacing spaces and other non-letter characters with hyphens, or removing them altogether. If you look at the HTML for this page you'll see the `Tables` header looks like this:

```html
<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
```

And the `Coding styles` header uses a hyphen to replace the space:

```html
<h2 id="coding-styles">Coding styles</h2>
```

And the more complicated example of the header named `The "third" list type: definition lists`:

```html
<h3 id="the-third-list-type-definition-lists">The "third" list type: definition lists</h3>
```

### Bookmarks must be unique in an HTML document

The `id` attribute must be unique within a document. Notice how on this page there are many headers simply called `You type:`? Metabuzz keeps track of them and turns each of them into unique IDs by naming them `you-type-1`, `you-type-2`, and so forth.

### How to create bookmarks manually

Suppose you want a bookmark that's not a header? You can insert one anywhere by starting a Markdown line with the pure HTML code for anchors. (HTML is [allowed in Markdown with a few restrictions](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#html-blocks).


You type:

```
<a name="jump-here"></a>
```

Then you create a link to it by adding the `#jump-here` portion to a link, which is noted by the web browser but not displayed:

```
[Learn about blockquotes](#jump-here)
```

Try it now: [Learn about blockquotes](#jump-here)

### Linking to bookmarks on other webistes

You can also link to an anchor to other websites, if they have anchors. Here's a link to the history of futbol on Wikipedia:

#### You type:
```
[History of futbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#History)
```

#### It takes you right there:

[History of futbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football#History)


## Header styles

#### You type:
```
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
```

#### It shows as:
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

## Coding styles

```
You can format text inline as `code`, or go block style:
```

You can format text inline as `code` by surrounding text with `` ` ``tick marks`` ` ``, or go block style by enclosing the lines of code in a "fenced code block", which begin and end with 3 tickmarks:

#### You type:
    ``` 
    print ("This is a code block")
    ```

#### It shows as:
``` 
print ("This is a code block")
```

### Choosing the language

You can specify a color scheme for a particular programming language by including its name after the first 3 tick marks of the code block.

#### You type:

    ``` python
    print ("This is a code block")
    ```

#### It shows as:

``` python
print ("This is a code block")
```

``` go
fmt.Println("This is a code block")
```



## There are 2 or 3 kinds of list types

#### You type:
```
### Ordered lists

1. Ordered lists have numeric sequences
1. Even though you write `1` in Markdown,
1. The numbers display properly on output
```

### Unordered, or bullet lists

#### You type:
```
Reasons people hate bullet lists

* It reminds them of bad PowerPoint
* I actually like bullet lists
  + You can indent bullet lists
  + Just go in a couple spaces, and use `+` instead of bullet
  + The `+` isn't required. It's just for clarity
    - Most Metabuzz themes go up to 3 visible levels
    - Any more levels than 3 makes it hard for the reader
```

### The "third" list type: definition lists

A definition list lets you display things like an item
and its meaning in a distinct way:

#### You type:
```
Definition list
: A way to show a visual relationship between a word or phrase
and an explanation for it

Markdown
: A convention for generating HTML from a more human-readable 
source format.
```

### Markdown trick: Creating clickable image links in Markdown

Remember that a Markdown link looks like this:

```markdown
[Twitter](https://twitter.com)
```

And that an image link looks like this:

```markdown
![Twitter logo](twitter-32x32-black.png)
```

You can combine them to make a clickable image, like this:

```markdown
[![Twitter logo](twitter-32x32-black.png)](https://twitter.com)
```


#### You type:
```
[![Twitter logo](twitter-32x32-black.png)](https://twitter.com)
```


## Tables

Use this method of creating tables. Columns are normally left-aligned,
but `:|` on the row of dashes right-aligns a column, and  `|:--:|` center-aligns a column.
Headers are always centered.

#### You type:
```

| Left-justified Contents |  Centered Contents   | Right-justified Contents   |
| ------------------------ |:--------------------:| --------------------------:|
| Row 1, Col 1             | Row 1, Col 2         | Row 1, Col 3               |
| Row 2, Col 1             | Row 2, Col 2         | Row 2, Col 3               |

```

And here's what results from the table markdown shown above:
#### It shows as:

|  Left-justified Contents |  Centered Contents   | Right-justified Contents   |
| ------------------------ |:--------------------:| --------------------------:|
| Row 1, Col 1             | Row 1, Col 2         | Row 1, Col 3               |
| Row 2, Col 1             | Row 2, Col 2         | Row 2, Col 3               |

## Block quote

#### You type:
```
>Hypocrisy waits silently for us all. 

```

#### It shows as:
> Hypocrisy waits silently for us all.
