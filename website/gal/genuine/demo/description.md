About half the themes that come with Metabuzz are based on Wide. Most of the others are based on the Pillar theme. Wide and Pillar are largely similar but Wide is elastic---its header and footer stretch with the web page size. Pillar, on the other hand, is a fixed-sized column that occupies the center of the screen, with gaps on the sides of the header and footer.

When you create a Markdown source file and don't specify a [theme](themes.html#frontmatter), Wide is the one that's chosen. Likewise, when you create a new theme or pagetype, that new theme will be based on Wide if you don't choose otherwise.
