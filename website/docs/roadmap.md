# Metabuzz Roadmap

Here's what's coming up next for Metabuzz.

**Unit tests** Obviously my top priority is to fill in the unit testing

**Search support** via something like [elasticlunr](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js)

**Web-based version and hosting** so nontechnical users can throw together sites quickly without knowledge of the command line or GitHub

**Table of contents generation** when I can figure out how to add custom parsers to [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark)

**What else? Check the [issues](https://github.com/metabuzz/metabuzz/issues) I don't know what reaction Metabuzz will get, if any, but what I do know is that it will probably not be what I expect it to be. So check the issues section for up-to-date feedback
