# Pillar-style themes

Pillar-style themes stand in a column in the middle of the page, with gaps on the right and left sides. This differs from the Wide theme, which is the basis of most other Metabuzz themes. Wide has a header and footer that stretch to the ends of the page. 

Pillar themes reduce distraction because they tend to be less information dense, making it easier to focus on the article text. The Wide themes leave more room on the page for multiple kinds of content.
