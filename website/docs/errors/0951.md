## Error message: Site already exists

Metabuzz won't create a site on top of an existing one.

## How you got here

* You already created a site:

```
mb new site mysite
```

* Then you tried to create a site by that same name:

```
:: FAIL!
mb new site mysite
```

## What to do about it

There's no way to replace a site using Metabuzz. You'll have to delete the site directory manually.
