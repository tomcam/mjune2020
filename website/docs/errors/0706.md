# 0706 BE SURE TO ADD THIS TO ERROR-CODES.MD

## Unable to read from headtags directory (error code mbz0706)

The headtags directory is missing.

## How you got here

Metabuzz expects to find a directory named [.mb/headtags](../headtags-dir.html). It's generated when you create a [new site](../new-site.html). For some reason that directory can't be found.

## What to do about it

Just create a directory named `.mb/headtags` in your site directory.
