## Error message: Unable to open theme directory 

There is no theme directory by that name available.

## How you got here

A theme name is also the name of the directory 
that contains it. This occurs when there's no
installed theme by that name (installed simply
means the theme directory at `.mb/themes/`).

```
===
theme="just doesn't exist"
===
```

## What to do about it


If you're wondering why you see that message when you didn't even add a `theme=` to your front matter, it's because
the [site file](../site-file.html) specified one. (It's a handy feature when you're using one theme frequently
and don't want to repeat the `theme=` on every page.)
