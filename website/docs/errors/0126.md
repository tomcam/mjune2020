## Error reading config file


## How you got here

There was a [metabuzz.toml](../config-file.html) file but something in it isn't right

## What to do about it

The problem is almost certainly a missing quote or two.

**Properly formed metabuzz.toml entry**

```
configdir="/Users/anna/code/m2/.mb"
```


### Here are some bad examples:

**Missing an opening quote**

```
configdir=/Users/anna/code/m2/.mb"
```

**Missing an closing quote**

```
configdir="/Users/anna/code/m2/.mb
```

**Quotes omitted altogether**

```
configdir=/Users/anna/code/m2/.mb
```
